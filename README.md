This Blazor WebAssembly application allows users to interact with two different external APIs:

Star Wars API: Users can input a character ID to retrieve information about a Star Wars character, including name, height, mass, hair color, and more. The data is displayed in a card format.

Weather API: Users can search by city name to retrieve current weather conditions.

The application sends requests asynchronously to a backend API, which interacts with the external APIs and returns the results to be displayed in the UI.
